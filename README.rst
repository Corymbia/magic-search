===================
Magic Search Widget
===================

This is an AngularJS widget that provides a UI for faceted and text search.


Sass/Compass Setup
------------------
The CSS files are pre-processed using Sass, so you'll need to set up a Sass-to-CSS watcher to output CSS.

To set up Compass as the file watcher...

::

    sudo gem install compass
    cd eucaconsole/static
    compass watch .


Grunt - JavaScript Task Manager
===============================

Grunt Setup
-----------
* At home directory `./magic-search`
* Install npm if missing: 
::

    yum install -y npm

* Run 
::

    npm install

to install npm packages listed in the file `package.json`
